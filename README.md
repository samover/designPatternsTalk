# DESIGN PATTERNS

Codebase that accompanied talk @iCappsBarcamp Feb 2017 on design patterns in
node js in the ligth of code quality and testing.

The goal is to create code

    - with high cohesion (SRP)

    - loose coupling (DInj & DInv)

This way it is easily testable in isolation (London style vs Chicago style).
